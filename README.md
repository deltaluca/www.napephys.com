Website for Nape Physics Library.

Introduction:

Nape is a powerful, fast, and friendly 2D Rigid Body physics engine for AS3/Haxe. Nape is open-source and free to use for personal and commercial projects. Available for AS3 through .swc libraries and Haxe via haxelib.

Features:

Rigid Body physics with Buoyancy and a variety of Constraints.
Convex-Polygon and Circle shape types.
Powerful, high-level Callbacks system.
Pixels as units of distance.
Continuous Collisions/Sensing to avoid tunnelling.
An API that reports errors when used incorrectly. (Error checking and reporting disabled for release builds.)
Automatic handling of sleeping/waking, no general need to ever wake a Body manually.
Friendly, expressive API that uses a lazy implementation to avoid excessive calculations.
Fast!
Memory conscious implementation, no GC activity when used correctly!
Numerically stable Geometric utilities including Convex Decompositions.
Ability to create new Constraints without modifying Nape source. Through the symbolic module, can prototype new constraints using a high-level language specified at run-time.
All positional-constraints, including user-defined ones can be made elastic or stiff.
